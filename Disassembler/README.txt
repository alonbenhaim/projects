A disassembler is a computer program that translates machine language into assembly language. This program can open and read in a .OBJ file created by PennSim, 
parse it, and load it into a linked list that will represent the LC4’s program and data memories (similar to what PennSim’s “loader” does). It is 
able to read in a .OBJ file and convert it back to the assembly it came from! This is known as reverse Assembling.
